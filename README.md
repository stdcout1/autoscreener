# autoscreener
## How it works?
Autoscreener uses selenium to login via the password you provide. Pretty basic stuff; used back bypass for extra login steps and captcha. (click "back" after you login)

## How to install:
1. clone repo to local machine
2. add your own chrome driver if you want. I included windows and mac. 
3. create a file called password.pw
    1. first line should be your email
    2. second line should be your password
4. add to your library or run alone.
